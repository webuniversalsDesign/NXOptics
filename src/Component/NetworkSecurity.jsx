<h4>Security Solution</h4>

<p>Our managed security services eliminate the ongoing critical task of staying updated
 with the most advanced security technologies. Fueled by our technology and business insights 
 into customers just like you, we customize our managed security services to suit them to your 
 business needs. Our managed security services extend your resources to effectively tackle new security threats

<h4>How safe your Network, Web Server and Corporate Data?</h4>

<p>Vulnerability Assessment/Penetration Testing can assist you in security and 
maintain a secure ISO I7799, PCI-DSS or HIPAA compliant network. A Penetration
 Test (Pentest) is a controlled security review conducted by an independent security 
 professional who attempts to break into a client's computer system. A Penetration
  Tester employs the same tools and techniques as real intruders, but a Penetration
   Tester does not damage the systems or attempt to steal information. A Penetration Tester reports on the 
vulnerabilities that were found and recommend the ways that they can be fixed.</p>

    <p style={{color:"white"}}>Working as a precursor for a complete Disaster Recovery Plan, a Network Audit is about taking
     stock of all the hardware and software assets of a company. This identifies your IT assets, where
      they are located, who is using them and their configurations. The Network Audit report is essential for
     network documentation and PCI-DSS, FDCC, SOX, HIPAA and GLBA audit compliance.</p>

                <p>An External Penetration Test or an Infrastructure IP Penetration Test
                 focuses on server penetration testing, router penetration testing, 
                 operating system installation and maintenance. An infrastructure
                  penetration test is performed against your companies nominated 
                  Public IP's across one or more ISP's. These findings will determine
                 how an attacker would use that information to compromise your IT Security.</p>

                 Internal assessments use a similar methodology to an external assessment,
                  however the engagement will occur from within the WAN at each logical

                <h5>On-Site Security Assessment</h5>
                <p>An attacker will visit a site on a periodic basis; see if there is a
                 new way to break into your system. If they find a way, they will leave 
                 a way to get in at a later date. The end result, you will be attacked 
                 and the ferocity is only limited by the skill of the attacker. Current
                  security providers will traditionally perform an assessment for a given 
                  period of time (two weeks) once a year. The problem is that you are safe
                   for that two week period, and then left unprotected for the remaining 50
                    weeks. Our Proactive Penetration Testing monitors changes and alerts you
                     about them on a daily basis!</p>
